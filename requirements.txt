Description:
This program allows the user to interact with the volcano dataset through visualizations.
The first visualization is a map of all the volcanoes in the dataset. The map defaults to every volcano in teh data set,
but can be filtered by country or by a last known eruption. A bar chart visualizes the number of volcanoes per country
and can also be filtered by last known eruption to only include a count of volcanoes within the time frame. Additionally,
a user can enter in geographic coordinates and a chart updates to show the ten closest volcanoes to the coordinates and
the volcanoes distance in miles. Lastly, seaborn is used to plot a histogram
